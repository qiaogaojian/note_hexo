just because I needed it recently – and it made me think of this little gem that I still had to share: what if you have to **search over multiple lines in multiple files** in VSCode .. something that actually might happen more than you want to admit.
  
I actually never knew how to do this decently, until I came across this tweet:
```
 Well… after some digging I found it (literally few moments after my post).
 
 One must use [\s\S\n]+? (at least for CRLF UTF-8 files).  
 In my case I was searching for all trans-unit occurence with specific source:  
 <trans-unit id="Enum[\s\S\n]+?</source> 
```

The core of the “solution” is this RegEx: `[\s\S\n]+?` 或者 `[\s\S\n]*?` 
  
To explain you simply:
  
*   `\s`: matches any whitespace character (space, table, line breaks)
*   `\S`: matches any character that is not a whitespace character
*   `\n`: matches a line feed character (code 10)
*   `[]`: matches any character in this set
*   `+`: matches one or more of the preceding token – in this case, the set of any character including the line feed
*   `?`: causing the preceding quantifier to match as few as possible. So – take all, but as few as you can.

#### Here are a few examples:

Find all translation-info spread over multiple lines..

`<trans-unit id="Enum[\s\S\n]+?<\/source>`

Or find “CLEAN19” code snippets with

`if not CLEAN19[\s\S\n]+?#endif`

And don’t forget to put your search in VSCode in “RegEx” mode (ALT+R)!

Thank you, [phenno](https://twitter.com/phenno1), for sharing! It might not work for all cases, it might need some finetuning – but for the searches I needed, it always did its job ;-).
